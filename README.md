# CodeAlpha-Task-1-WebScraping-

## Overview of Project
This task focuses on extracting data from the web using Python.  
I used the BeautifulSoup library to scrape text data from a public website and created a structured dataset (CSV file) for further analysis.

##  Objectives:
1. I was able to understand and implement web scraping techniques.
2. I was able to parse and clean data from HTML pages.
3. And also export the data into a usable CSV format for further analysis.

##  Tools Used
1. **JupterLab**
2. **BeautifulSoup**
3. **Requests**
4. **Pandas**

## Steps Performed in Acheiving the Web Scraping:
1. I imported necessary libraries to perform Web Scraping (Beautiful Soup, Pandas,Requests).
2. I sent a HTTP request to fetch webpage content.
4. I also parsed the HTML structure using BeautifulSoup.
5. Then I extracted text, quotes, and authors from the webpage.
6. Ater which I stored the cleaned data into a **CSV file** for further analysis.


The final dataset (`quotes.csv`) is included in this repository.
